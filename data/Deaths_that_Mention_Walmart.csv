"Louisiana","2017","FRANK","ARMANDO","Frank was known around his small town as ""the man on the tractor"" since he frequently drove his red tractor around Marksville. He was a lifelong resident of the community, according to a federal lawsuit.     Though it's unclear what deputies knew about Frank's background, at least one of them knew that he was a military veteran. The deputy says he tried to establish a rapport with Frank by telling him that he is also a military veteran, the deputy said in interviews with investigators.     Medical records from the U.S. Veterans Administration indicate that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.","https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072109-frank_warrent_that_includes-dob https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072108-frank_va_records_incl_mental_health https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072111-frank_amended_complaint","Medical examiner said in the autopsy that officers failed to provide aid to Frank after he was dragged off the tractor; In a deposition, the medical examiner said he thought they should have rendered aid.      A lawsuit also notes accuses the officers of violating Louisiana law by not telling Frank about the warrant that led to the encounter, even though he asked several times why they wanted him to climb down from his tractor.","A carotid sleeper hold that evolved into a bar hold is cited in the autopsy.     ""There are injuries that are consistent with evidence of a manual strangulation,"" the pathologist wrote in the autopsy.     Officers also pressed Frank's body against his tractor. He was cuffed face-down with his hands behind his back and ""multiple personnel partially on back and neck."" He was then loaded into an SUV face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back.    All told, Frank sustained 6 minutes and 42 seconds of respiratory compromise, the autopsy states.    Officers also failed to render aid, the pathologist wrote after reviewing body cam video. Someone on the video is heard asking, ""is he breathing, get him up, but there is no response and no action,"" the autopsy states.    In a lengthy deposition, the pathologist says he thinks that officers should have helped Frank after the physical encounter.    ""I think they should have given him basic first aid, that's what I think,"" he said.    ""I'm pro law enforcement,"" he added. ""I just want us to do better. I want us to learn.""","","The case might be a good storytelling opportunity. Armando Frank, known around his small Louisiana town as ""the man on the tractor,"" was sitting atop his red tractor in a Walmart parking lot when three officers tried to remove him from it and take him into custody. They tased Frank multiple times, used a carotid sleeper hold that evolved into a bar hold, pressed Frank's body against his tractor, and eventually pressed on his body as he lay in a prone position and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. It's also an example of law officers failing to provide aid after the initial encounter, per autopsy findings and the deposition of the medical examiner.","1973-09-05","2017-10-20","44","Male","Black","Unknown","https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/armando-frank-obituary?pid=187075452","[""History of mental illness"",""Military veteran""]","[""Other""]","2017-10-20","Marksville","Louisiana","Parking lot","[""Avoyelles Parish Sheriff's Office"",""Marksville Police Department""]","Other","Arrest warrant pending","[""Calm conversation to establish rapport"",""Verbal persuasion"",""Delay taking action to give deceased time to calm down or comply"",""Warnings of imminent force or restraint""]","[""Failing to respond to officer commands""]","[""Taser or Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) - darts"",""Taser or Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) - drive-stun"",""Struck with baton or other object"",""Chokehold or carotid restraint"",""Handcuffs"",""Prone position - with officer bodyweight or pressure""]","[""Left deceased face-down"",""Bodyweight pressure""]","SKIP - no longer collecting","In their initial police statements, the officers either fail to mention the neck holds, or downplay them.","https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072097-frank_detailed_incident_report https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072105-frank_supplementary_report https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072100-frank_investigative_report https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072111-frank_amended_complaint","[""Local sheriff""]","[""Federal""]","Pending","0","Federal lawsuit is pending in U.S. District Court in Louisiana (Western District)","https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072111-frank_amended_complaint","Homicide","Asphyxia due to respiratory compromise due to law enforcement arrest with contribution of hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, obesity (BMI=37) and electronic control device shocks.","[""Prone position"",""Positional asphyxia"",""Law enforcement""]","Louisiana Forensic Center LLC","2022-10-06 15:32:00","[""Mental illness"",""Taser""]","","Ongoing","Ongoing","https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072114-frank_autopsy#document/p4/a2119798 https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22072096-frank_deposition_of_medical_examiner","2022-11-01T05:18:49.392Z"

"Nevada","2012","YBANEZ","GLENN","For question 9: While perhaps not best qualified as ""medical emergencies,"" the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department did make an issue of Ybanez's past medical history in a police report.   In the report, LVMPD investigators said Ybanez had an apparent “medical episode” a few days prior to his death, on June 30, while shopping at a Walmart. Video surveillance showed Ybanez approaching Erica Matanane, his girlfriend, and holding onto a shopping cart while he fell on his knees. He then sat down on a crate of watermelons, ate something and eventually got up and walked away, according to the police report. Matanane, who was driving the vehicle prior to the traffic stop that ended in Ybanez's death, told police she thought Ybanez might be diabetic because of this episode. Ybanez’s mother told police through Matanane Ybanez had a heart murmur when he was younger.  Also for question 9: Richard Ybanez, Glenn's brother, identified Glenn as a veteran in an interview and said his brother had served as a medic in the Army. However, the Clark County coroner's investigation did not check the box identifying Glenn as a veteran.   For question 10: Through a records check, the officer who pulled Ybanez's girlfriend over for conducting a lane change without a blinker learned that Ybanez had outstanding warrants out for his arrest for distributing / manufacturing a controlled substance / possession of a controlled substance, according to a report from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.","Deceased/1: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123906-ybanez-autopsy#document/p1/a2134030 Deceased/2: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22131264-glenn-ybanez-guam-veterans-cemetery#document/p4/a2139619 Deceased/3: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123912-ybanez-coroners-investigative-report#document/p1/a2134031 Deceased/4 and 5: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123906-ybanez-autopsy#document/p2/a2134032 Deceased/7: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123912-ybanez-coroners-investigative-report#document/p1/a2134033 Deceased/9 (veteran): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123910-richard-ybanez-transcriptdocx#document/p10/a2134034 Deceased/9 (veteran): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22131265-glenn-ybanez-military-confirmation#document/p2/a2139621 Deceased/9 (substance use): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p2/a2134035 and https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p32/a2134036 Deceased/11 (Walmart episode): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p20/a2134038 and https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p21/a2134039 Deceased/11 (diabetic): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p32/a2134037 Deceased/11 (heart murmur):  https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p32/a2134040 Deceased/11 (coroner's report): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123912-ybanez-coroners-investigative-report#document/p1/a2134041 Deceased/11 (records check): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p8/a2134042","","On July 2, 2012, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department pulled over Erica Matanane for changing lanes without using a turn signal. Glenn Young Ybanez, 37, was in the passenger seat of the car. Ybanez had outstanding warrants out for his arrest in Colorado, which Officer Nolan Hamilton learned when he checked Ybanez’s record. Hamilton started a pat down on Ybanez, but he took off running shortly afterward. Once Hamilton caught up with him, an altercation ensued. Three civilian witnesses helped detain Ybanez. At some point after he was handcuffed, Ybanez became unresponsive. He was transported to the hospital, where he died two days later.  For question 14, ""Other"": After Ybanez took off running, he dropped a partially open knife. (One witness told police he “threw” it, “almost striking her. Corrine O’Brien, who witnessed some parts of the incident, said she thought Ybanez was going to try to “stab the cop with it” but had accidentally dropped it.)  For question 17, ""take down"": Mike Cagaanan, a maintenance worker at the nearby Budget Suites who helped subdue Ybanez, said Hamilton “tackled” Ybanez. Russell Miller, another civilian who witnessed the event and was involved in subduing Ybanez, gave a slightly different description of these events. He said Hamilton caught up to Ybanez and grabbed him by the back of the shirt, then said the two “fell” to the ground.    Also for question 17: The civilians who were involved in the incident also used force on Ybanez. Miller said he grabbed Ybanez’s left arm and Mills put his knee on Ybanez’s left shoulder as they worked to help Hamilton handcuff him.  For question 26, ""mitigating circumstances"": Civilians did not start the restraint/force but were involved in the altercation after it began.","","The death of Ybanez, who is from Guam, did not get much mainland media attention in Nevada. The fact that it was ruled an “accident” by the medical examiner, along with the many abrasions detailed on his autopsy and the fact that he had a brain bleed, raise questions about the unacknowledged role police may have played in his death.","1975-04-02","2012-07-04","37","Male","Asian","Unknown","","[""History of substance abuse"",""Military veteran""]","[""History of substance abuse""]","2012-07-02","Las Vegas","Nevada","Parking lot","[""Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department""]","Traffic stop","Traffic violation","","[""Flee by foot"",""Other"",""Ignoring commands""]","[""Take-down"",""Handcuffs""]","[""Unknown""]","SKIP - no longer collecting","","Incident/1: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p8/a2134044 Incident/2 and 3: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p1/a2134048 Incident/4: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p2/a2134046 Incident/5: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p1/a2134047 Incident/8 and 9: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p2/a2134049 Incident/12: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p37/a2134050 Incident/14: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p8/a2134051 Incident/17 (take-down): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p28/a2134054 Incident/17 (handcuffs): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p9/a2134056 Incident/21: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p30/a2134057 Incident/27 (knife throw): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p25/a2134052 Incident/27 (""stab""): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p31/a2134053 Incident/27 (falling to the ground): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p33/a2134055 Incident/27 (civilian use of force): https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123909-glenn-ybanez-police-report#document/p9/a2134058","","[""No""]","","0","Richard Ybanez, Glenn’s older brother, said in an interview that the family looked into filing a lawsuit over his death but that the lawyer they initially contacted ultimately backed out of the case.","Accountability/5: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22123910-richard-ybanez-transcriptdocx#document/p3/a2134059","Accidental","Ybanez “died as a result of DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY.
